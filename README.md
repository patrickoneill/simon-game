Code Institute Project to create a memory game using 

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript / JQuery

The project is mainly used to show off the abillity of JavaScript

### HTML5

I've used the basic HTML code for the layout .
Links for the CSS and Audio files are in the head of the index.html
with there file paths to keep things neat. JS link at the bottom as per best 
practice so that the page loads before the JS file.
All section in the index.html have an ID so that they are easily targeted in 
CSS & JS.

### CSS

The game components have been created by the CSS file. Using the # selector 
for easy styling. Using border-radius , sizing and margin to place to pieces 
together
